1 template driven form
	- we use to create a form 
	- login,signup,f/b form 
	- u can perform basic level validation on view side 
2 FormControl
	- it is angular inbuild class 
	1 valid  => true
	2 invalid => true 
	3 touched => true 
	4 pristine => true 
	5 dirty  => true 
	6 errors => It is a Object Internally 
	
	steps 
	1 To create instance of FormControl => we have to use ngModel attribute directive without notation & use name attribute
	2 to create template ref variable & assign your ngModel to it 
	3 for the validation we use errors object & we have to use required attribute given by html 
	
3 ngForm
4 json
